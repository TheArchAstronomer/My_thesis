I made this for myself. Why this is publicly available on github is a mystery even to myself.
I will update this as I go along and provide more files and links to make this a useful cheat sheet in case I forget something. 
An explanation of different coordinate systems:

Regular
    Cartesian:
        Regular x, y, z coordinates. Most commonly used system. Good if you're defining your own space where stuff takes place. A very intuitive system. 

    Polar: 
        An alternative approach to the cartesian system. Instead of using straight lines to define points, this system uses a radius and an angle to mark the position of a point.
        This is good for something, I'm sure.

        Cylindric / spherical:
            Cylindrical coordinates are an offshoot of polar coordinates. A 3D version which gives depth to the planar data. Imagine a physically accurate penguin if you will.

            Spherical coordinates works similarly to cylindrical ones, but instead of having an angle in only one axis, spherical coordinates have a position defining angle 
                in two axes.

Astronomical systems
    Galactic:
        A galactic coordinate system is a system in which the Sun (Sol) is taken as the center (0, 0, 0) of the coordinates. 
        

    Galactocentric: 
        A system in which the center of the galaxy (in this specific instance, the Milky Way galaxy) is taken as the origin of the coordinates. A similar system to cylindrical 
        coordinates, but a special case where the center and axes are predetermined.
